# Field: Publish Notes

Lets you add arbitrary HTML to the Publish screen.

## Installation

1. Upload the 'publishnotesfield' folder in to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Publish Notes", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.
3. Add "Publish Notes" to your sections wherever you feel the need.

## Notes

* The "Label" field is required by Symphony, the extension outputs your "Label" in handle-ised form as the ID if your notes field on the Publish screen. While not immediately useful it gives you a hook for use by custom JavaScript if you need it.
* With great power comes great responsibility: the "Note" field let you put whatever you want in it and that raw output is included on the Publish screen.
